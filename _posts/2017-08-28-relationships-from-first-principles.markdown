# Relationships from First Principles

Have you experienced hanging out with a friend who you thought you knew really well, but then when they meet someone new, and that new person asks your friend questions, you find yourself learning things about your friend that you never knew?

That has happened to me on many occasions and I'm surprised almost every time.

It's even more surprising them I'm with my girlfriend, Xuejing, and this happens. I think my first reaction is I find myself feeling a hint of jealousy or perhaps shame like "I totally should have known that. Why didn't *I* think to ask her before?!"

In contrast, this doesn't happen when I'm connecting with people who I still consider myself getting to know. And recently, as I was connecting with several friends and we were having these wonderfully intimate connections in which I felt really present and there was a feeling of excitement and aliveness—I found myself wondering "Why don't those feelings come up as often now when I'm with Xuejing when they used to be present in our connection all the time? Aren't we supposed to be in a relationship with each other and the warm fuzzies should be there even more than before and certainly more than when I'm connecting with others?"

From noticing those sparks of connection with others and asking myself why those sparks may be less present now with Xuejing, I realized two things:

(1) I had developed the attitude of "I know everything about her already" whereas before at the beginning of our relationship I had the mindset of being super curious about her and asked her about everything

(2) now, we had defaulted to seeing each other every Saturday which looked like one of us going to the other's home without a game plan of HOW we actually wanted to spend that time together. In contrast, at the beginning of our relationship, either one of us had to reach out to the other and explicitly ask the other if they wanted to do X, Y or Z things. One person needed to *intentionally* ask to do something specific, so when we met, there always was an explicit intention.

One experiment we tried two days ago to address (1) was to pretend we were on a first date. I came with an attitude of curiosity and assumed that I knew nothing about her. I could feel my presence and feeling of intimacy rising dramatically and she said she felt similarly--it really began to feel like it had a vibe of a first date. I learned things about her that I had not known at all, some crazy adventure she had been on, some life hack to get her through grad school, things about how her relationship with her parents that I found so profound I started taking notes. We carried this spirit of curiosity over to yesterday and I to learned how dramatically dance had positively impacted her life. I felt so many warm fuzzies ^__^

To address (2), we just cancelled the default of seeing each other on Saturday, which didn't mean we didn't see each other on Saturday--it just meant that one of us needed to reach out to the other to explicitly propose something. As a result--we went on our first day trip to Dia Beacon and it was a blast especially coupled with the intention of being curious about each other.

Upon reflection, I think it's silly for me to think I should know so many things about a person and that I never would need learn anything new about them. After all, each of us is changing constantly. There's an analogy in the meditation world that analogizes humans to a river. We may call some body of water by some name, but when you walk away from a body of water and come back to that supposedly "same" body of water, it is a completely different river – there are probably very few of the same H2O molecules present in the expanse of water that you see when you come back and most definitely almost all the H2O molecules are not in the same position—and yet we call the river by the same name. This is just as "I" am called Jonathan even though I am a mass of constantly changing and shifting cells made up of constantly shifting and changing particles. Jonathan at the beginning of his life or even Jonathan yesterday and Jonathan now are made up of very different particles and certainly the same particles are in different configurations--skin sheds, I use the bathroom, my life experience changes and so does my brain chemistry, among others.

From this point henceforth, I am setting the intention to stay in a space of continual curiosity when spending time with anyone and assume that I don't know many, many things about them and will continually discover who they are in each moment!

Shoutouts to Harshita Gupta, Dave Fontenot, Susie Fu, Ryan Cheney and Ashley Qian for the many conversations, shared ideas, and connections we've had that shifted, informed,

and contributed to this experience.

A special shout out again goes to Alton Sun and also Kelly ChowChow for a conversation I had with them around this topic. Their relationship and their intentionality is certainly an inspiration to me : )

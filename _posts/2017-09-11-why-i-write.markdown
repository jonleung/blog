# Why I Write

So I saw Malcom Gladwell on the train and I was like—omg, Mom, that is totally Malcom Gladwell. I pull up Google Images and yup, that was totally Malcom Gladwell.

After some taking a bit of time to scarf down some food (I was starving), write some notes, and come up with some questions, I muster up my courage and proceed to walk over to his seat.

The conversation looked something like this:

In a wavery voice I ask: "Hi, are you Malcom Gladwell?"
> — "Yes"

I think to myself, *crap, no backing out now...*. I then utter "I'm an aspiring writer and was wondering if I could ask you for some advice?"

—"Sure." He then moves his stuff aside so I could sit down.

Thinking about what to say, I asked him a question I was thinking about with Dan Morse. I ask Malcom (we're totally on a first name basis now) "I'm struggling to figure out a theme to write about. My thoughts and my writing seem to be about a bunch of different random things and I'm not sure how to connect them all together. In your books, you so beautifully and coherently connect so many different stories into this grand story around one central theme and I'm wondering how I might learn to do that."

I don't want to quote him without his permission here so I'll just share what I got from the conversation (but maybe it's more that I don't exactly remember what he said...):

Everyone has a pattern in the way that they think, just try to identify what the patterns are in my writing

Ask yourself the questions:


• Where do your ideas come from?

• What attracts me to these ideas?

• Why do you have these ideas?

I asked him if I could get his feedback on my post about relationships (the one I wrote about relationship defaults on August 6th http://bit.ly/2xSjuwG)
He said to shoot him an email, and so I emailed him a copy of my post and answers to the questions he posed me:

>Hi Mr. Gladwell,

> hank you for taking the time to gift your advice with me. I went home and reflected and answered the questions you posed and discovered new facets about myself I never knew. I feel so alive after reflecting upon the reasons why I care about the things I care about! Thank you so much—that really made a difference.

>Your writing has been very pragmatically helpful in my life, especially Blink, and I aspire to become a thought leader like you so I might be able to share ideas I think that matter and could really make a difference.
When you have time, I would love your high level feedback on a post I wrote recently wrote as well any thoughts you have on my reflections to the questions you posed. I'll defer to you to decide which kind of feedback you think would be most helpful to me.

## Answers to the Questions you Posed Me

### 1) Where do your ideas come from?
I think and write about relationships and emotional self-work.
Upon reflecting on the question of why, I realize my interest in relationships may stem from the fact that I was made fun of a lot from when I was 4 years old to 18 years old. I felt really insecure in that time. I constantly tried to consciously figure out how to interact with people so I wouldn't be made fun of. But I think having exercised this cognitive muscle of "figure out how to interact with people without being made fun of" gave me the practice of evaluating what things worked in social relationships and what things didn't. Today, instead of thinking how to satisfying my desire of how to not be made fun of, I am thinking about how to satisfy my desire of "how do I deeply and authentically connect with someone else". But perhaps this wouldn't be possible today if I hadn't exercised the muscle since I was a kid.
When I was younger, I really wished that people shared with me how to navigate social situations. I remember one time I went up to one of my very popular and empathetic cousin asking him in a very strained and pleading voice, "@keith, how do I be cool?" Now, having changed my way of interacting with people in a way that I feel connected rather than being made fun of and realizing a lot of it has to do with emotional self-work, I feel really excited to share what I've gotten with others so they may get what I wish I could have gotten when I was younger. It feels like giving. And the more positive feedback I get, the more I want to share.

### 2) What attracts me to these ideas?

Understanding and learning to be and work with my emotions has been the most transformative thing in my life. It's fundamentally transformed my minute by minute experience in daily life and completely transformed my relationships with people.

In situations in which I used to get frustrated or annoyed, now in situations like last time when a baby was crying through an entire flight, I felt relaxed, caring, and even a little warm hearted. In situations in which I'm explicitly being blamed for something [insert colleague or close friend or family], before, I might react and tell that person why they are wrong, I now can listen from a place of compassion and can step out of my own drama to hear what they are needing.

We say that people who do good things are good and people who do bad things are bad. But looking at the news, do you think those who are performing hurtful deeds would still perform them if they had a really good relationship with themselves and their emotions? I think not. Yet the way we are trying to stop (react) to these deeds is by force of military, protest, or words. But if in the first place, emotional education was in place, would those who would want to perform hurtful deeds even arise?

Relationships and emotions I think are perhaps one of the most important part of the human experience, perhaps the most important. The best and worst moments of our lives are colored with strong emotion.

But from my perspective, our society seems to think that emotions just kinda happen and we can try to deal with them one way or another at worst by suppressing them or controlling them, or at best, sharing our emotions with other people, getting a therapist, or meditating. But society doesn't seem to have any clear ways for someone to learn how to work with their emotions in the same way that there have been a growth of many schools, bootcamps, and many online resources you can use to to learn how to code.

How can we have such a laissez faire attitude about learning about our emotions when emotions essentially are the fabric of how we experience every moment in our lives, from the best moments, to the worst?

What's absolutely insane to me is that there exists whole libraries of knowledge around how we can work with our own emotions. There is a whole body of western research and eastern philosophy and practices that have systematic and practical tools and approaches that can teach us about how to be with our emotion!

This is WHY I AM SO COMPELLED TO SHARE all the tools I've learned to become who I have become today. From Chan Buddhism, Vipassana Meditation, Alexander Technique, Focusing (created by Eugene Gendlin), Internal Family Systems Therapy / Parts Work, Circling and Authentic Relating, The Rationality Movement, the work from Landmark Education, and Non-Violent Communication, I have been given so many tools to live in harmony with my emotions and therefore others and I am so excited to continue to share many of these tools with others.

### 3) Why do you have these ideas?

I think many of my ideas come from my "engineering" brain. From the first paragraph, I wrote that I wanted to "figure out how to interact with people without being made fun of".

I think the words "figure out" are key because I've always been very analytical (made LEGO things since I was a kid, made robots in high school, studied computer engineering in college, etc.)

The steps are, identify the problem, define a solutions criteria, keep trying things until you find a solution, repeat.

This analytical side I think is a very good compliment to the less analytical emotional brain. My analytical brain is a strong, powerful, but perhaps too default of a lens with which I view the world.

More reflection required...

I want to give a shoutout to my mom, Linda for giving me the capacities for courage and curiosity to talk to anyone and to be curious with them. You've been training me since I was a kid and it's really made a huge difference in my life. Love you mom!

A shoutout goes to Sophia Ciocca and Zach Valenti for their own sharing which has really inspired me to share with others.

Also, a shoutout to you for reading all the way to the bottom : )

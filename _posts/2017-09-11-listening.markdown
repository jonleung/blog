# Listening

I'm beginning to feel the impact of what it's like to listen to someone from a place of continual emotional curiosity and not trying to push an agenda or to fix them or their problems in any way. I'm learning to have more moments where I'm just there to discover what's present for them in each moment.

After I listen, I try to reflect (essentially paraphrasing) what they say back to them in an effort to try to make the other person feel heard or to give them an opportunity to make a correction or emphasize a point to increase my own understanding.

Here's an experience recently that I was excited about:

I spent time with someone for whom I traditionally acted as a mentor for. Upon reflection, in many of my previous interactions I had with this person, I was in the context "it's my job to figure out what they're doing wrong so I can fix it by telling them what they should do". Wow, this doesn't feel to fun for me to admit to myself now... In this last interaction though, before the meeting, I set the intention in my daily Intention setting (a version of the "stand up meeting" that I do every day with Xuejing Lin) to be a space for this person and listen and not try to fix them in any way.

I feel excited about what emerged. I felt an excitement and aliveness that I never felt before in this person--I really could hear and get what was really important to them at this point in their life and why it felt really crappy for them to not have it and how much they wanted it (I know I got it because I would repeat my understanding of what I said and they would chorus back "YEAH--EXACTLY!!")

They ended up making several big discoveries for themself that they never really realized about themself--and all I had to do was listen and ask questions--I didn't make that discovery for them--in fact I couldn't, they discovered it for themself. (Ok if I'm being honest, there were definitely many moments of me giving straight up advice but I'm learning OK XD)


## Gratitude

Alton Sun, among many other things, thank you for sharing the way you do on FB, it's inspired me to try to create my own form of sharing here : ) Seeing your thoughts on FB is super fascinating and I really appreciate your sharing. I thought wow, maybe other people may appreciate me sharing my thoughts too!--And as I write this last bit, I notice myself feeling self conscious "WHO ARE YOU to say that other people may value your thoughts!". That part I notice is afraid of looking bad because other people may judge him to be full of himself. "Part, I hear you and although some people may judge you, it's ok, i think many other people may be appreciative just as you're appreciative of the sharing of Alton and Olive B. Persimmon. #partswork #internalfamilysystems

Thank you to the many people who helped me on me reach the beginning of my journey to be a more active listener--some that come to mind now are Xuejing (among many other things, you've taught me circling and the power of being present in conversation) Harshita Gupta Laura MacKinnon (you are the first person to call me out on not being present in conversation) Danielle Lynne Strachman, and my Landmark seminar leader, Evan Lambert. Also, a shout out had to go to everyone I've ever had a conversation with : )

And a special shoutout to Amy Silverman and all the amazing authentic relating work that I've attended including Circling Lab for Beginner & Experienced Circlers and Connection Camp (of the The Connection Movement NYC, Authentic Relating NYC)
